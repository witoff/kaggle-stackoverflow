### Code submission for Kaggle Stack Overflow challenge

Initial development was based on [this](http://fastml.com/predicting-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow/)

And some of the code is derived from there. The data extraction (data2vw.py)
was rewritten from scratch, integrating the two scripts from the above post.

Another area I expanded was to automate the whole process using a Makefile, 
and additionally introducing cross-validation implemented entirely using
shell tools (GNU parallel was very useful).

I generated an expanded set of features, based on segmenting the documents
into code and non-code sections. The non-code section was further segmented
into sentences, and then into words (using NLTK). I also looked at some
metrics about the user, as well as some aspects of the sentence structure,
such as number of questions, exclamations etc.

Data can be downloaded kaggle from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow/data) (recommend using chrome's copy as cURL to pull directly to processing machine)

### Example Data

Source CSV data looks like this:
```csv
PostId, PostCreationDate, OwnerUserId, OwnerCreationDate, ReputationAtPostCreation,
OwnerUndeletedAnswerCountAtPostTime, Title, BodyMarkdown, Tag1, Tag2, Tag3, Tag4, Tag5,
PostClosedDate, OpenStatus

4,07/31/2008 21:42:52,8,07/31/2008 21:33:24,1,0,Decimal vs Double?,"I'm new to C#, 
and I want to use a trackbar for the forms opacity This is my code....<FULL TEXT>",
c#,vb.net,timer,,,,open

<and 70 million more lines>
```

Which is then converted into the vowpal input format to look likes this:
```bash
4 1.0 4

trackbar use for when forms to build new type opacity then tried get implicitly convert 
but me not worked a c i double decimal work try this can error making the trans my 

|vtags c
```

And a model is then generated by VW from this commands 
```bash
./vw --loss_function logistic --oaa 5 --quiet -d train.vw -f train.model

# and we can output our predictions using this model
vw -t  -i train.model -d train.vw -p train.predictions
```
